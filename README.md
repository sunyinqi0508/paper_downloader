# Research Paper Downloader
This script is intended for personal research purposes only. I prefer downloading them so I can read them on my phone/tablet when I'm not at school. The usage of downloaded papers is subject to the terms of their respective copyright owners. 

- [vldb_crawler.py](./vldb_crawler.py): A multi-threaded VLDB paper downloader that automatically renames paper filename to its title. 
- [sigmod_crawler.py](./sigmod_crawler.py): A SIGMOD paper downloader that names the saved paper to its title. Please note that SIGMOD downloader requires a valid subscription to ACM. If login is required, log in on a browser and export cookies to ./cookies.txt. Use this script with EXTREME CAUTION and do not shorten the interval time between downloads or use multiple downloading threads since it will stress the server and will result in a BAN on your IP and/or Account.
